# Sales Data Analysis Dashboard in Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview

This project is a data analysis dashboard created in Microsoft Excel to visualize and analyze raw sales data imported from a CSV file. The goal was to uncover key business insights, identify trends, and provide data-driven recommendations.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Microsoft Excel**: The primary tool used for the entire project.
- **PivotTables**: Utilized for aggregating and summarizing large datasets to create key performance indicators (KPIs) and summaries.
- **Slicers**: Implemented to create interactive filters for the dashboard, allowing users to quickly segment data by year.
- **Charts & Graphs**: Used a variety of charts (Donut, Bar, Line, Pie) to visually represent sales trends and product distribution.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard was designed to track the following crucial metrics:

| KPI                  | Value        | Insight                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Sales** | 273,749,135  | Indicates a strong overall revenue performance.                      |
| **Quantity Sold** | 33,816,674   | Shows high product demand and customer interest.                       |
| **Average Unit Price** | 14.265       | Reflects consistent pricing strategies.                               |
| **Sales Transactions** | 7,811,354    | Demonstrates a large volume of transactions.                           |

## Key Insights and Recommendations

Based on the dashboard’s visualization, the following insights and recommendations were identified:

### 1. Top 5 Products by Total Sales
- **Insight**: Cargo, Mountain, Touring, and Road Bikes are the top-performing products.
- **Recommendation**: Continue to focus on these high-demand products and consider offering bundled packages with less-performing items to increase their sales.

### 2. Total Sales by Region
- **Insight**: The “Alex” (Alexandria) and “Delta” regions are leading in sales.
- **Recommendation**: Investigate the success factors in these top-performing regions and replicate the strategies in other areas to boost sales.

### 3. Average Sales Over Months
- **Insight**: Sales consistently peak around August and December.
- **Recommendation**: Plan promotional offers and marketing campaigns just before these peak seasons to maximize revenue.

### 4. Sales Distribution by Product Category
- **Insight**: “Bikes” account for the majority of sales.
- **Recommendation**: Explore opportunities to develop related products and expand the market share for other categories to diversify revenue streams.
